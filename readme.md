## Description ##


## Installation ##

### WordPress Plugins Directory (Recommended): ###
1. Visit **Plugins > Add New**
2. Search for **Social Manager by NineCodes**
3. Activate **Social Manager by NineCodes** from the Plugins page.

### Manual Upload: ###
1. Download the plugin `.zip` archive.
2. Visit **Plugins > Add New**.
3. Click **Upload Plugin**
4. Click the **Choose File** button, and select the plugin `.zip` archive you have just downloaded.
6. Click the **Install Now** button.
3. Activate **Social Manager by NineCodes** from the Plugins page.

### FTP Upload: ###
If none of the above ways work, though it will be less convenient, you can try installing the plugin via FTP (File Transfer Protocol). To do this, you will need an FTP software installed on your computer, such as:

* [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) (Windows, macOS, Linux)
* [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/) (Windows, macOS)
* [CarotDAV](http://rei.to/carotdav_en.html) (Windows)

Then, login to your server *with the credentials given by your hosting provider*.

1. Download the plugin `.zip` archive.
2. Unzip the archive and upload the `ninecodes-social-manager` folder into the plugin folder (`/wp-content/plugins/`).
3. Activate **Social Manager by NineCodes** from the Plugins page.

### Once Activated: ###
1. This plugin adds a new setting page named **Social** under the **Settings** menu in the WordPress admin screen. You can customize the output made by the plugin through this page.
2. This plugin also adds some extra fields in the user profile edit screen (`/wp-admin/profile.php`).
2. This plugin registers a custom route at `ninecodes-social-manager/1.0/buttons`.

### For Theme Developers: ###
If you are a Theme developer, you can add `add_theme_support( 'ninecodes-social-manager' )` in `functions.php` of your theme themes to customize the plugin at Theme level. The following are the "features" that we currently support.

**Remove the plugin stylesheet**

Set the `stylesheet` to `false` will dequeue the plugin stylesheet. This allows you to customize the the plugin output through your theme stylesheet to match your theme design as a whole without having to do an override.

```
add_theme_support( 'ninecodes-social-manager', array(
	'stylesheet' => false,
) );
```

**Custom attribute prefix**

The plugin add prefix `ninecodes-social-manager` to (almost) any HTML elements it outputs at the front-end (your theme), for example:

```
<div class="ninecodes-social-manager-buttons ninecodes-social-manager-buttons--content ninecodes-social-manager-buttons--content-after" id="ninecodes-social-manager-buttons-1241"><div class="ninecodes-social-manager-buttons__list ninecodes-social-manager-buttons__list--icon" data-social-buttons="content">
</div>
```

Don't like it? You can change this prefix to anything you prefer by adding the `attr-prefix`, for example:

```
add_theme_support( 'ninecodes-social-manager', array(
	'attr-prefix' => 'social',
) );
```

Keep in mind setting the prefix to other than 'ninecodes-social-manager' will also dequeue the stylesheet much like setting the `stylesheet` to false; you will have to add the styles on your own.

**Changing the Buttons Mode**

The plugin offers 2 modes, `HTML` and `JSON`, to generate, what we call it, the **Social Buttons**; the buttons that allow your site users to share share content on social media. By default the mode is set to `HTML`, which will *echo* all the HTML markup in the post content. But, if you are building a [*headless* WordPress theme](https://pantheon.io/decoupled-cms) using whatever JavaScript renders (Backbone, Angular, React, Vue, Ember, you name it), you might want to switch the plugin to the `JSON` mode.

```
add_theme_support( 'ninecodes-social-manager', array(
	'buttons-mode' => 'json',
) );
```
