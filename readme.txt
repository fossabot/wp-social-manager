Lightweight, clean and optimized social media plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin helps you optimize your website for social media with [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview) meta tags. Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites will evaluate these meta tags to understand your content better and enable to preview the content on the [News Feed](https://www.facebook.com/help/327131014036297/) nicely. This plugin allows you to customize the meta tags, so you have more control over your posts and pages presentation.

Other features included in the plugin:

= Social Media Buttons =
Display social buttons to allow your readers sharing your website posts and pages to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Reddit, etc. You can also display the social buttons on the images within the content.

With the increasing trend on using WordPress as a [*headless* CMS](https://2016.sydney.wordcamp.org/session/using-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms/), this plugin also exposes a couple of custom **JSON API** routes using the [WP-API](http://v2.wp-api.org/) infrastructure in WordPress. The API allows developers to retrieve the social media sharing endpoint URLs of a particular post or page and render the sharing buttons in, for example, a JavaScript-based theme.

= Social Media Profiles =
With this plugin you can add your social profile and page URLs and display them on a widget. No need to mess around with your theme Menu ever again; the widget will stay there even when you've changed the theme.

= FTP Upload: =

If none of the above ways work, though it will be less convenient, you can try installing the plugin via FTP (File Transfer Protocol). To do this, you will need an FTP software installed on your computer, such as:

* [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) (Windows, macOS, Linux)
* [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/) (Windows, macOS)
* [CarotDAV](http://rei.to/carotdav_en.html) (Windows)

Then, login to your server *with the credentials given by your hosting provider*.

2. Unzip the archive and upload the `ninecodes-social-manager` folder into the plugin folder (`/wp-content/plugins/`).
3. Activate **Social Media Manager** from the _Plugins_ page.

= Once Activated: =

1. This plugin adds a new setting page named **Social** under the **Settings** menu in the WordPress admin screen. You can customize the output made by the plugin through this page.
2. This plugin also adds some extra fields in the user profile edit screen (`/wp-admin/profile.php`).
3. This plugin registers a custom route at `/ninecodes/v1/social-manager/buttons`.

== Theme Support ==

If you are a Theme developer, you can add `add_theme_support( 'ninecodes-social-manager' )` in the `functions.php` of your theme themes to customize the plugin at Theme level. The following are the "features" that this plugin currently supports.

**Remove the plugin stylesheet**

Set the `stylesheet` to `true` will dequeue the plugin stylesheet. This allows you to customize the the plugin output through your theme stylesheet to match your theme design as a whole without having to do an override.

<pre lang="php">add_theme_support( 'ninecodes-social-manager', array(
	'stylesheet' => true, // Means the theme supports (loads) the stylesheet.
) );</pre>

**Custom attribute prefix**

The plugin add prefix `social-manager` to (almost) any HTML elements it generates at the front-end (your theme). You can change this prefix to anything you want by adding the `attr_prefix`, for example:

<pre lang="php">add_theme_support( 'ninecodes-social-manager', array(
	'attr_prefix' => 'social',
) );</pre>

Keep in mind that changing the prefix to other than `social-manager` will dequeue the stylesheet much like setting the `stylesheet` to `true`. So you will have to add the styles at your end.

**Changing the Buttons Mode**

The plugin offers 2 modes, `HTML` and `JSON`, to generate, what called as the **Social Buttons**; the buttons that allow your site users to share content on social media. By default the mode is set to `HTML`, which will *echo* all the HTML markup in the post content. But, if you are building a [*headless* WordPress theme](https://pantheon.io/decoupled-cms) using whatever JavaScript renders (Backbone, Angular, React, Vue, Ember, you name it), you might want to switch the plugin to the `JSON` mode.

<pre lang="php">add_theme_support( 'ninecodes-social-manager', array(
	'buttons_mode' => 'json',
) );</pre>
